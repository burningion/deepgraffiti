Generating Glitched Faces to Confuse Facial Recognition Neural Networks

You'll need to have Caffe installed, and also the Age Net from the Model Zoo. By default I've left GPU mode enabled, you'll probably want to disable that.

Run generatenoise.py to get haarcascade recognized faces from noise.

Run mirrorfaces.py to have face.jpg get scanned for faces, and then have them be tiled and Deep Dreamed on.
